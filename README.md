### About the Project
Sazerac Analytics is a project that aims to bring the future to web application development by making it easier to understand what the users want and how they want it. This is done by creating a heatmap of user clicks on the given application. Using the heatmap a developer that knows the frequency of clicks on each element of their application, is able to easily make optimizations to the design, thus improving UX. All information is stored on a separate server, and is available through a detailed and stylish menu.
